# Configuration example for Network Automation Tool
# Copy this file to config.py and update with your actual values

# OpenAI API Configuration
OPENAI_API_KEY = "your-openai-api-key-here"

# Security Best Practices:
# 1. Never commit config.py with real API keys to version control
# 2. Use environment variables in production:
#    import os
#    OPENAI_API_KEY = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
# 3. Add config.py to .gitignore
# 4. Consider using a secrets management service for production

# To get an OpenAI API key:
# 1. Visit https://platform.openai.com/api-keys
# 2. Create an account or sign in
# 3. Generate a new API key
# 4. Copy the key and paste it above

# Note: The API key provided in the code is for demo purposes only
# and should be replaced with your own key for production use.
